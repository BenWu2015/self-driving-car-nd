    "\n",
    "*The full project video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/Q3Y2qpATP08).*\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.\n",
    "* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.\n",
    "* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.\n",
    "* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (\"birds-eye view\").\n",
    "* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.\n",
    "* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.\n",
    "* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.\n",
    "* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Components and Modulization\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the design goals, we create a pipeline made of 7 components. Each of these are described here briefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CalibrateCamera:** Python class that handles camera calibrations operations\n",
    "2. **ImageFilters:** Python class that handles image analysis and filtering operations\n",
    "3. **ProjectionManager:** Python class that handles projection calculations and operations\n",
    "4. **Line:** Python class that handles line detection, measurements and confidence calculations and operations.  There are two instances of this class: LeftLane and RightLane.\n",
    "5. **RoadManager:** Python class that handles image, projection and line propagation pipeline decisions\n",
    "6. **DiagManager:** Python class that handles diagnostic output requests\n",
    "7. **advanced_lane_pipeline.py:** Main Python CLI component that handles input/output filename checking, option selections and media IO.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a block diagram of how the classes are organized to process an image or a video (sequence of images):\n",
    "<img src=\"output_images/advanced_lane.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Implementation Details\n",
    "The following sections describe the implementation of the pipeline in detail and why this particular implementation was chosen.  Some factors of the architecture decision was based on efficiency, or observed improvements with video processing that were not observed when processing single images.  Where such observations were made, the subsequent improvements mostly improved both single image and video processing.  Cases where the improvements made single image processing suffer, we decide to make the change anyway, since we are bias toward making the lane boundaries identification video processing better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Camera Calibration\n",

    "<img src=\"output_images/chess_corners.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\">\n",
    "<img src=\"output_images/cal/calibrated1.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are done with camera calibrations, we can save the results of the distortion correction matrix generated by the OpenCV *calibrateCamera* function into a pickle file for later usage without having to regenerate them again and again.  The generation, saving to pickle and later retrievals are all handled by the **CalibrateCamera** module mentioned earlier, and you may view it [here](advanced/CalibrateCamera.py).\n",
    "### 2.2 Pipeline (Single Images)\n",
    "After generating the camera undistortion matrix, we can now start using test images to practice finding lane lines using our software pipeline as we are in development.\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Test Images\n",
    "We were given a set of eight test images to start with.  However, we added an additional images from the project, challenge and harder challenge videos.  They are shown in the next session where we undistort them like the camera calibration chessboard images.\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 Distortion Correction\n",
    "The first thing the advanded_lane_pipeline does when it starts its pipeline modules is to use the **ImageFilters** module to correct the distortion in the image using the generated distortion correction matrix obtained by the **CalibrateCamera** module using camera calibration techniques as discussed.  Below, the raw/unprocessed test images are shown on the left and the results of the distortion correction is shown on the right.  They may look very similar until you look at their edges.  The distortion corrected images have a smaller field of view than the uncorrected image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Undistorted Test Images](output_images/undistorted.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.3 Image Filters\n",
    "Next the **ImageFilters** module will apply filters to the images in an attempt to isolate the pixels that makes the lane lines.  In each of the subsections, we will describe a filter deployed by the **ImageFilters** module either in sequence or in combination.  You may view the **ImageFilters** module [here](advanced/imageFilters.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.3.1 RGB Colorspace Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most difficult lane lines to isolate are the yellow lane lines.  Since they use only two of the three RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color components, Red and Green, we can just use brightness (Luma) to detect them like white lines.  This become perticularly difficult when we encounter yellow lane lines in images with poor visibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 2.2.3.1.1 Red\n",
    "\n",
    "Using thresholding on the red color channel in an RGB colorspace, we can render this image from the poor visibility image:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How we do it is we apply the following to a RGB image with pixels in unsigned 8-bit integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        rEdgeDetect = img[:,:,0]/4\n",
    "        rEdgeDetect = 255-rEdgeDetect\n",
    "        rEdgeDetect[(rEdgeDetect>220)] = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this filter does is that it compresses the red color channel space to 1/4 its normal value, then it inverts it so that its lowest value now becomes its highest.  Then a threshold is selected to drop any value higher than it to be 0, in this example the value 220 was selected as the threshold.  (Remember, since we divided by 4, our range became (255-63 to 255), or (192 to 255.)  What we are left with is a set of pixels that at higher than normal intensity compressed and then forced into a higher set of values within the red color channel.\n",
    "However, this filter does not work for all cases, and become perticularly difficult when we encounter yellow lane lines drawn on nearly white concrete backgrounds as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Yellow Lane Lines on Concrete Bridge](test_images/test1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "![ImageFilters applied on test1](output_images/test1diag1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need to continue searching for additional image filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.3.2 Sobel Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sobel operators combine the idea of Gaussian smoothing and differentiation filters and is at the heart of Canny edge detection algorithm.  Since the filter takes the first, second, third, or mixed image derivatives of the grayscaled image, the result is more or less resistant to any noise in the image and reliable edges are produced.  More about the OpenCV libraries implementation of the Sobel operator is available [here](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html#sobel).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 2.2.3.2.1 Sobel X and Y Derivitives\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sobel image derivitives in the X direction is given by the following formula assuming a 3x3 kernel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Sobel Operator derivitive in the X direction](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/_images/math/f2531c53069c2dabcab2bcb391518bd65dc535eb.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sobel image derivitives in the Y direction is given by the following formula assuming a 3x3 kernel.\n",

    "\n",
    "Kernels must be 1, 3, 5, or 7.  Kernels of larger size will provide a softer smoother gradient image.  For our purpose, we need sharp edges, so a kernel of 3 was defaulted.  Once we have the results, we need to take the absolute value of the derivative or gradient and scale them back to 8-bit unsigned integers, since we will be, in essence, using it as a bitmap to isolate the lane lines.  The **ImageFilters** module uses the following code to create the filter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "        # Apply the following steps to img\n",
    "        # 1) Convert to grayscale\n",
    "        # 2) Take the derivative in x or y given orient = 'x' or 'y'\n",
    "        # 3) Take the absolute value of the derivative or gradient\n",

    "###### 2.2.3.2.2 Sobel Magnitude and Directional\n",
    "The idea of taking the magnitude (Sobel XY) of the Sobel X and Y results is to see if there is a distance factor in the individual components in the gradient that can be used to further isolate the lines/edges in the image.  Sobel XY is calculated by squaring the X and Y components of the Sobel operator and then take the square root of their sum, and, in essence, calculate the magnitude of changes in intensity that being experienced by that pixel in that image.  If there is an absence of any one of the components for a particular pixel, then the value produced at that pixel is just the same as for the Sobel X or Y component remaining.  The formula is:\n",

    "Obviously by now, we know that Sobel operations, in all of its wonderful various forms, will not fulfill our yellow lane line finding needs.  Its now time to look at other colorspaces for inspirations.  This time we will look at HLS (**Hue**, **Lightness** and **Saturation**).  **Hue** represents color independent of any change in brightness.  **Lightness** represents luminacity or brightness, and can be compared to converting an RGB image to grayscale.  **Saturation** is a measurement of colorfulness as compared to *whiteness*.  The HLS (hue, lightness, saturation) color space is a cylindrical representation of the RGB model. **Hue** is measured in degrees around the circumference of the cylinder. *Red* is at 0°, *green* at 120°, and *blue* at 240°, then wrapping back to *red* at 360°. Note that there is a discontinuity at 0° and 360°. **Saturation** is measured in percent from the center of the cylinder to its radius. Lightness is measured in percent from the bottom to the top of the cylinder.  You can find more information about colorspaces [here](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/243610/the-known-colors-palette-tool-revised-again) and [here](https://www.script-tutorials.com/what-is-a-color-model/)\n",

We are interested in filtering for the yellow lane lines against white background since the Sobel functions are excellent in filtering for edge detection based on luminance already.  The **Hue** color channel is an obvious candidate for filter yellow lane lines, and **Saturation** (value of color away from white) will help too.\n",

    "##### 2.2.3.5 Image Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "What is at issue is that we were applying the same thresholds on different images with different lighting conditions.  As with previous Machine Learning techniques, we learned that normalization of the data were essential for being able to retrieve useful information.  This is no exception.  The idea is that based on statistics of the images we have, we should be able to figure out what is the optimum filter combination for each type of image, so that we don't have to treat them all the same.  So, first we have to generate a set of useful information on the images as a base to try to figure out how to generate more tailored filter combinations.  Below are the results of this study.  The **ImageFilters** module uses the *imageQ* function to generate the statics:\n",

In the next stage of the pipeline, we will be performing a perspective to plane transform, and one of the issues with doing these types of transforms are its nonlinearity, particularly at the vanishing point, which is one of the points along the horizon of the perspective image.  As you approach the vanishing point, a short vertical distance in pixel space, represent a very large distance when projected in birds-eye view.  We will describe this in more details in *section 2.2.6, Lane Line Measurements.*\n",

    "One of the major difference between Project 1 and 4, is the requirement to apply a perspective transform to rectify the binary road image to a (\"birds-eye view\").  The reason to do this is to more easily identify the lane lines and to make curvature measurements.  We will use the **Pinhole Camera** mathematical model to transform the perspective view of the image plane into a planar 'birds-eye' view (view looking down from above).  See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera_model) for the mathematics involved in doing projections in a **Pinhole Camera** model.\n",

See here for all of the mathematics involved in doing [Camera Calibration Calculations](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/calib3d/camera_calibration/camera_calibration.html) in OpenCV.  Once we have the *camera focal length*, we need to calculate the transform from the image plane to the 'birds-eye' view plane.  This involves calculating what is known as the [**Camera Matrix**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_matrix).  This matrix is a 3x4 matrix which describes the mapping of a pinhole camera from 3D points in the world to 2D points in an image.\n",

Project 1 back to the rescue with the Houghline function.  Recall we used the Houghline function to approximate the lane line locations.  Those identified lane lines are parallel in perspective, since they are suppose to form the lane lines which are also in parallel in perspective.  If we assume that the base of the lane lines, where the lane meets the bottom of the image, is also parallel to another line that is near the horizon, then we have a rectangle that are formed by the two sets of parallel lines (see the red lines in the left image below.)  We can use the corner points of this rectangle as our source points and then map them to a planar surface by warping their points as describe below using the orange and light blue dashed arrow lines.  The blue dashed line indicates that the image on both sides of the transform are symmetric and will remain symtric during the transformations. Therefore, we can repurpose so of the old codes from Project 1 to perform the initial task of not just estimate the lane lines, but to also calculate our source points.  It is important that we are able to calculate this dynamically because, we do not know in advance if the camera is facing a road going uphill or downhill and the perspective transform for them will be quite different and make it harder to identify lane lines.\n",

In general, we will be using the *HoughLinesP* function to find the left and right lane lines.  Using linear algebraic calculations, we will identify the Y intercept of both lines.  This, in theory, is where both the horizon is at and also the vanishing point in perspective.  From there, we will have to calculate a \"backoff\" from the horizon, since points near the vanishing point is theoretically at infinity and will not be useful.  Our current rule of thumb for a standard backoff during initialization is at 30 pixels; however, this is now no longer static and can be dynamically change during video processing based on detected horizon from the **ImageFilter** module which we will describe in section 2.2.6, Lane Line Measurements.

To understand this stretching effect better, we drew a dark green hexagon in the perspective image, and then projected it onto the planar 'birds-eye' view in the lower-left panel.  Notice how the bottom of the hexagon is now much smaller in the birds-eye view than in the perspective image?  What about the top of the hexagon?  The sides of the two longer sides of the hexagon are now parallel in the 'birds-eye' view.  What kind of stretching do you think are involved?  Also, notice how far to the top that the concrete bridge ends in the perspective image, but it seem quite short in comparison in the planar birds-eye view?  What's happening there?\n",

It is important to keep in mind that the perspective transform is non-linear, especially near the **horizon** and particularly at the **vanishing point**.  What this means is that as you go closer and closer to the **horizon/vanishing point** in the perspective image, things are going farther and farther away.  This become quite non-intuitive in that what we assume is quite near, is often quite far away.

This will be the topic in this section.\n",

However, by now the lane tracking should be close to 100% confidence (see section 2.3.4, Confidence Calculations).  So, now the **ProjectionManager** no longer needs to perform its line approximation to find its source points to transform the image from perspective view to 'birds-eye' view mentioned in section 2.2.4.  Instead, it will start using the source points as it was discovered when the lane lines reached 100% confidence.

This line mask is similar to the region of interest that we used before in Project 1, but instead of masking the entire region where the lane lines could be, we are creating a mask using the found lane line in the previous frame 'birds-eye' view and now applying it to the new frame.  We are creating this mask using the polynomial we fitted before and creating a polygon by adding an offset to either side.  By default it is +/-30 on both sides of the polyline during initialization, but afterwards drops to only +/-5:\n",

    "Remember, these masks are applied by the **Line** modules individually, so the left lane line has its own mask, and the right lane line has its own mask too.  If the lane lines were successfully found, the found points are gathered together and another polynomial is fitted.  This polynomial in turn will then create its own polyline and a line mask and the process repeats.  Now its time to figure out if we were successful in finding the lane in this frame.\n",

    "#### 2.3.4 Confidence Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "After the masking of the lane line points, the **Line** module counts the number of pixels were captured by its mask and then calculates its confidence of finding the lane line in this frame.  Remember in section 2.2.5.3, Fitting a 2nd Degree Polynomial, we said that we were only counting half of the points?  We mention that there were two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Faster: Less point counting means less time spent processing\n",
    "2. Allow for increase Confidence in Subsequent frame processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed we already talked about before, since our python script was doing the counting, it was less efficient than if Numby or OpenCV did the job.  Now, lets explain why counting half would increase confidence.  As explained before, we counted half of the points and then doubled it for the `self.confidence_based`.  This was because we were quite sure that in the subsequent frame, the lane line points would be there to reach double the point count as long as we were accurate in our findings at the beginning.  \n",

    "#### 2.3.5 Losing Track and Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this pattern, it seems that this algorithm could sustain itself forever, but all good things must come to an end, so in this section we will discuss what happens when we lose track of the lane lines and how do we recover.  For example, the first concrete bridge after the curve has always been a challenge.  First it was the yellow lane lines on white concrete background, now we find that it causes the projection to become misaligned, and so the lane lines no longer match for the right lane line.  At frame 560, the right lane line finally drops below its 50% threshold at 238 pixel count on the concrete bridge and declares it no longer has confidence in its tracking abilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Project Video Frame 560](output_images/project_video_frame560.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At frame 561, the **RoadManger** module initiates a complete restart and goes back to the same routine as described in section 2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Project Video Frame 561](output_images/project_video_frame561.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This in turns sets up a confidence of 50% with a threshold of 716 pixel count for the left lane and 321 pixel count for the right lane.  At frame 562, the **RoadManager** and **Line** modules attempt to restart the faster process at outlined previously in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Project Video Frame 562](output_images/project_video_frame562.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And was successful in reaching 100% confidence on both left and right lane lines again, with a pixel count of 8549 for the left lane line and a 2882 pixel count for the right lane. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.6 Failure Intervention\n",
    "\n",
    "During this process of analyzing lane line-tracking loss, we used our diagnostics tools to figure why we were failing so often.  We actually had a lot more failures before, and our predictions were less accurate.  We wanted to find a better way to prevent these failures in the first place while maintaining a more efficient process.  In this section, we discussed some failure prevention methods we discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.3.6.1 Missing RoadManager and Line Component Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before putting together our intervention method, we notice that the **Line** modules only fed their statistics forward to the **RoadManager** and there were no active feedback mechanism to have the **Line** module improve its performance by the **RoadManager** module.  So, there were alot of information being gathered by the **RoadManager** that were not placed into service to accurately predict the lane line locations.  We decided to change that.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.3.6.2 RoadManager Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "One of our discovery was that when the **Line** module loses track of a lane line; it is usually the points towards the horizon that were missed.  If we do not actively try to move back up and re-discover the lane line positions, we would lose the lane line completely and have to restart the process.  At first we tried different ways for the **RoadManager** to predict where the roadmarkings were and then force the **Line** component to search there.  This ended in all sorts of interesting lane line patterns that did not necessarily conform to what was actually in the video.  What we ended up doing was just to have the **RoadManager** tell the **Line** component to *go higher*, but only a little at a time *(ten pixels)*.  It seems this general request was all that was needed because the **Line** module actually knew what to do using its fitted polynomials.  It just needed to be told to extend its lane line mask higher up to encompass the extra points that were missed before.  Below are the new code segments added to **RoadManager** module to enable this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "        self.rightLane.requestTopY(rightTop[1]-10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that we split up how the **RoadManager** behaves based on detected visibility score from the **ImageFilter**.  This is because during low visibility conditions, the road horizon may be a very short distance away, and we should not aggressively climb back up the lane lines in case they are not there!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.3.6.3 Line Component Response\n",
    "\n",
    "When we put in the code segment to request for a movement in the **Line** module's polyline length, we needed an interface to have the **Line** module respond to this request.  We decided that the response for these requests should happen in the next frame, since trying to do everything in the current frame would slow things down, and have unpredictable results, so we added a new **Line** module *requestTopY* function.\n",
    "\n",

    "# road manager request to move the line detection higher\n",

    "    self.newYTop = newY\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function sets a new request into the **Line** module for a new top for its polynomial to reach.  In the next frame, the **Line** module respond by adding the requested point to its allY and calculates its corresponding X point:\n",

    "# honoring the road manager request to move higher\n",

    "## 3 Project Video Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained earlier, the project video shows the forward facing view of a multi-lane highway.  The road markings are mostly good, with some problems at the low contras areas around bridges.  The weather conditions are nice and the sky is clear.\n",

    "## 3.1 Harder Challenge Video Output\n",
    "The output for harder challenge video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/kGi_uHpsUl8). Clearly more work needs to be done to stabilize the lane lines detection in this challenge video.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The take away from the failure and recover points are that the current software pipeline, while bias towards removing false positives, may lack the flexibility to rapidly change its direction when the lane lines changes too much without resorting to a restart.\n",

    "## 4 Areas of Further Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "On reflection of what was learned during this project, our thoughts are we were not given enough time to do a full case study.  There are still numerous area on lane line finding that we would still like to explore, but have to abandon due to time constraints.  We are trying to document as much as possible on what we have learn up to now, so we can revisit it as time permits!\n",

    "### 4.1 Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This code was put together as an experiment/proof-of-concept, and not as something that goes into deployment.  Quite a bit of optimization can still be done.  We re-factored this code as many as 10 times during development.  Area of improvement for optimization includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removing experimental code segments\n",
    "2. Remove unneeded image caches\n",
    "3. Reduce image filter rules\n",

    "1. Gamma Correction on over exposed or under exposed images\n",
    "2. Improve contrast on low contrast images\n",
    "3. Experiment with boosting on harder challenge at low contrast areas\n",
    "4. Experiment with image enhancements in the 'birds-eye' view and warp back the correction in perspective\n",

    "### 4.3 Directing the Field of View (FoV)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore ways to control the Field of View from the transform perspective by dynamically calculating the optimal source points for finding the lane lines to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Control and isolate the areas where lane lines can be found, even on roads with high curvature\n",
    "2. Control **vanishing point** anomalies when dealing with planar 'birds-eye' views.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Localization\n",
